/// build` left there, from any commit — or nothing at all.

/// Both outcomes of that are lies about durability, and the second is the dangerous one:
///   * NOTHING there  -> the old code `return`ed with a "skip:" line and reported GREEN. That is how
///     `cargo test` can pass with ZERO over-the-ABI coverage of the durable store path.

///     read empty, which is BYTE-FOR-BYTE the signature of the unrelayed-seam defect this file
///     exists to catch (that defect was real: `DynStore`'s `impl Store` overrode 24 methods, none of
///     them the task/call-log methods, so `put_task` took the accept-and-keep-nothing trait

///     artifact NEWER than a regression reports GREEN while the shipped ABI is broken. Proven, not
///     theorised: with a regressed plugin in the tree and a good cdylib in `target/debug/`, the old
